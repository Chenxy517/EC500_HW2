# EC500_HW2 Problem_1: 

- ### **Group Member:** `Xingyu Chen, Zhaozhong Qi, Yuxiang Wan, Shuyan Zhang`

- ### **Labor:** There are no subdivisions to indicate which member has finish a particular part; Instead, each team-member helps the other and distributed fairly to build all the functionalities about this APP, includes all features of the buttons and attributes of the APP. 


## Introduction:

Note: This project was bootstrapped with the Platform of Android mained in Java Language, which could be found in details of [Android API 13](https://developer.android.com/about). API and Reference: Android 13, the latest version of Android, includes stronger protections for user privacy, improvements for developer productivity.


In this project, our team designed and deployed an a simple Android application who satisfies the following specifications:

- Display of the following additional metrics:
  - Elapsed time (in seconds) - since the start of the application (or the last reset);
  - Height of the phone (in meters) - based on GPS data;
  - Distance traveled (in meters) - since the start of the application (or the last reset);
  
- Ability for the user to change units for any measurement, among the following types:
  - Seconds ⟶ Minutes ⟶ Hours ⟶ Days
  - Meters ⟶ Kilometers ⟶ Miles ⟶ Feet
  - Meters per second ⟶ Kilometers per hour ⟶ Miles per hour ⟶ Minutes / mile
  
- An independent location processing thread that handles all location and measurement updates asynchronously.
